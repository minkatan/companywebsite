        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
          With over 20 years of experience in healthcare finance, our founder has served as CFO across multiple growth-stage and investor-backed organizations — from specialty care groups and diagnostics labs to digital health startups and CROs. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
          He’s led teams through everything from first-time audits to $100M exits, built finance functions from scratch, and translated complex operations into investor-ready metrics. His focus: give leaders better visibility, more confidence, and real control over their numbers.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
          After years of seeing founders get lost in financial ambiguity, he launched this firm to offer the kind of hands-on CFO support that drives strategic decisions — without the full-time headcount.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">
          Today, he partners with visionary operators across North America, turning messy data into momentum — and balance sheets into boardroom trust.
